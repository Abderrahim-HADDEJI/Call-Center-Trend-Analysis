As part of PwC Switzerlandâ€™s Virtual Case Experience on Forage, I analyzed customer call center data using Power BI to uncover key performance trends and provide strategic insights. 
The project simulated a real-world client scenario, requiring me to assess call center operations, identify inefficiencies, and propose data-driven recommendations to improve customer service. 
I developed interactive dashboards to visualize metrics such as call volume, response times, customer satisfaction, and agent performance. 
This experience honed my skills in data cleaning, DAX, and dashboard storytelling while reinforcing the importance of translating analytical findings into actionable business outcomes.
